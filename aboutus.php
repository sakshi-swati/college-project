              For a stable and effective environment, people have to learn how to build community especially in college . This is one of the critical roles of colleges is to help establish community to help benefit students later on in the future.

              In a recent study it was concluded that we become connected for reason of commitment rather than compliance meaning that people are bonded to each other as a result shared values, traditions, ideas, and interests.
<b>All our properties are built in such a way that you will feel connected like your home .</b> We know that our users work very hard so at the end of the day they  will need such place where they  can relaxed and feel comfortable.

              Zoyozo is started with a thinking in mind that <b>we will provide home like stay to a user in just a different city</b>. 
Zoyozo is that  kind technology startup that connects accommodation seekers and suppliers on one platform, exclusion of the middle-man.

              We tend to aim to produce a clear platform wherever users will see associate mass list of verified PGs and Hostels to settle on from. Users will see the reviews, tariffs, accessibility and different details bushed one place. You can book the hostel and mess in just one go by visiting to our website or app on google play store . All the process including payment is very smooth.
